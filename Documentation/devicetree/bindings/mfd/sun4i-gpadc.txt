Allwinner SoCs' GPADC Device Tree bindings
------------------------------------------
The Allwinner SoCs all have an ADC that can also act as a thermal sensor
and sometimes as a touchscreen controller.

Required properties:
  - compatible: must contain one of the following compatibles:
		- "allwinner,sun8i-a33-ths"
		- "allwinner,sun8i-h3-ths"
		- "allwinner,sun8i-a83t-ths"
  - reg: mmio address range of the chip,
  - #thermal-sensor-cells: shall be 0 or 1,
  - #io-channel-cells: shall be 0,

Required properties for the following compatibles:
		- "allwinner,sun8i-h3-ths"
		- "allwinner,sun8i-a83t-ths"
  - interrupts: the sampling interrupt of the ADC,

Required properties for the following compatibles:
		- "allwinner,sun8i-h3-ths"
  - clocks: the bus clock and the input clock of the ADC,
  - clock-names: should be "bus" and "mod",
  - resets: the bus reset of the ADC,

Optional properties for the following compatibles:
		- "allwinner,sun8i-h3-ths"
  - nvmem-cells: A phandle to the calibration data provided by a nvmem device.
		If unspecified default values shall be used. The size should
		be 0x4 or 0x8, depending on the amount of CDATA registers.
  - nvmem-cell-names: Should be "calibration".

Details see: bindings/nvmem/nvmem.txt

Example for A33:
	ths: ths@1c25000 {
		compatible = "allwinner,sun8i-a33-ths";
		reg = <0x01c25000 0x100>;
		#thermal-sensor-cells = <0>;
		#io-channel-cells = <0>;
	};

Example for H3:
	ths: thermal-sensor@1c25000 {
		compatible = "allwinner,sun8i-h3-ths";
		reg = <0x01c25000 0x400>;
		clocks = <&ccu CLK_BUS_THS>, <&ccu CLK_THS>;
		clock-names = "bus", "mod";
		resets = <&ccu RST_BUS_THS>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 31 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		#thermal-sensor-cells = <0>;
		#io-channel-cells = <0>;
	};

Example for A83T:
	ths: thermal-sensor@1f04000 {
		compatible = "allwinner,sun8i-a83t-ths";
		reg = <0x01f04000 0x100>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 41 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		#thermal-sensor-cells = <1>;
		#io-channel-cells = <0>;
	};

sun4i, sun5i and sun6i SoCs are also supported via the older binding:

sun4i resistive touchscreen controller
--------------------------------------

Required properties:
 - compatible: "allwinner,sun4i-a10-ts", "allwinner,sun5i-a13-ts" or
   "allwinner,sun6i-a31-ts"
 - reg: mmio address range of the chip
 - interrupts: interrupt to which the chip is connected
 - #thermal-sensor-cells: shall be 0

Optional properties:
 - allwinner,ts-attached	 : boolean indicating that an actual touchscreen
				   is attached to the controller
 - allwinner,tp-sensitive-adjust : integer (4 bits)
				   adjust sensitivity of pen down detection
				   between 0 (least sensitive) and 15
				   (defaults to 15)
 - allwinner,filter-type	 : integer (2 bits)
				   select median and averaging filter
				   samples used for median / averaging filter
				   0: 4/2
				   1: 5/3
				   2: 8/4
				   3: 16/8
				   (defaults to 1)

Example:

	rtp: rtp@1c25000 {
		compatible = "allwinner,sun4i-a10-ts";
		reg = <0x01c25000 0x100>;
		interrupts = <29>;
		allwinner,ts-attached;
		#thermal-sensor-cells = <0>;
		/* sensitive/noisy touch panel */
		allwinner,tp-sensitive-adjust = <0>;
		allwinner,filter-type = <3>;
	};
